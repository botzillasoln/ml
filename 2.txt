# a) Load and print any built-in dataset (we'll use 'mtcars' dataset)
data(mtcars)
print(mtcars)

# b) Calculate Variance for a chosen variable (e.g., 'mpg' - miles per gallon)
variance_mpg <- var(mtcars$mpg)
cat("Variance of 'mpg':", variance_mpg, "\n")

# c) Calculate Standard Deviation for the same variable ('mpg')
std_dev_mpg <- sd(mtcars$mpg)
cat("Standard Deviation of 'mpg':", std_dev_mpg, "\n")

# d) Calculate Range for the same variable ('mpg')
range_mpg <- range(mtcars$mpg)
cat("Range of 'mpg':", range_mpg, "\n")

# e) Calculate Mean Deviation and Skewness for the 'mpg' variable
# Mean deviation
mean_mpg <- mean(mtcars$mpg)
mean_deviation_mpg <- mean(abs(mtcars$mpg - mean_mpg))
cat("Mean Deviation of 'mpg':", mean_deviation_mpg, "\n")

# Skewness (using the 'e1071' package)
if (!require(e1071)) install.packages("e1071", dependencies = TRUE)
library(e1071)
skewness_mpg <- skewness(mtcars$mpg)
cat("Skewness of 'mpg':", skewness_mpg, "\n")

Conclusion:
The statistical analysis of the mpg variable from the mtcars dataset 
reveals key insights into its distribution. The variance and standard 
deviation indicate the spread of values, with standard deviation providing
 a more interpretable measure in the original units. The range shows the extent 
of the data, while the mean deviation highlights how much individual values
 deviate from the mean. Skewness reveals the asymmetry of the data distribution,
 with positive skewness indicating a longer right tail. These measures
 collectively help understand the variability and shape of the data.
