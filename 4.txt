The Spearman Rank Correlation Test evaluates the strength and direction of a monotonic relationship between two variables using their ranks. The test provides a correlation coefficient (
𝜌
ρ) ranging from -1 to 1, where values near 1 indicate a strong positive relationship, values near -1 indicate a strong negative relationship, and values near 0 suggest little or no monotonic association. Additionally, the p-value assesses the statistical significance of the observed correlation. If the p-value is less than 0.05, the correlation is considered statistically significant, implying that the observed relationship is unlikely due to chance. Conversely, a p-value greater than 0.05 indicates that the relationship is not statistically significant.
