In conclusion, the probability of getting heads when flipping a fair coin is 0.5, as there are two equally likely outcomes—heads or tails—making the chance of getting heads 50%. Similarly, the probability of drawing a spade from a standard deck of 52 cards is 0.25, because there are 13 spades in the deck, and the total number of cards is 52, resulting in a 25% chance of drawing a spade. These probabilities reflect basic concepts of equally likely outcomes, where the coin flip offers two possibilities and the deck contains four suits of 13 cards each.
