# a) Print any built-in dataset in R (we'll use the 'mtcars' dataset as an example)
data(mtcars)
print(mtcars)

# b) Get information about the dataset
# This gives a summary of the structure of the dataset
str(mtcars)

# c) Find dimensions of the dataset and view the names of the variables
dim_mtcars <- dim(mtcars)  # Get dimensions (rows, columns)
print(paste("Dimensions of the dataset: ", dim_mtcars))
colnames_mtcars <- colnames(mtcars)  # Get column names
print("Names of the variables:")
print(colnames_mtcars)

# d) Find the name of each row in the first column
# The first column in mtcars is the 'rownames' which represent the car names
row_names <- rownames(mtcars)
print("Row names (Car names):")
print(row_names)

# e) Print all the values of any variable of your choice from the dataset
# Let's choose the 'mpg' (miles per gallon) variable as an example
mpg_values <- mtcars$mpg
print("All values of the 'mpg' variable:")
print(mpg_values)

# f) Get a statistical summary of the dataset
summary_mtcars <- summary(mtcars)
print("Statistical summary of the dataset:")
print(summary_mtcars)

# Conclusion
cat("\nConclusion:\n")
cat("The 'mtcars' dataset provides information about various car models, including variables such as miles per gallon (mpg), number of cylinders (cyl), horsepower (hp), and others.\n")
cat("It contains 32 rows (car models) and 11 variables. The statistical summary gives insights into the central tendency, spread, and outliers of the variables.\n")
cat("For example, the average miles per gallon (mpg) is around 20.1 with a range from 10.4 to 33.9 mpg.\n")
